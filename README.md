## Percolation

This is an algorithm to test whether a 2D mesh, with randomly occupied cells will perculate i.e. there is an unobstructed passage between the top and the bottom rows. The graphics below show an example of such an object, where **black** cells are considered empty (0's).

The table on the right percolates, while the table on the left does not.
